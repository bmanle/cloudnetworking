# Define the Requirement Exercise
* What services should the public cloud deployment offer to the customers?
* How will the users consume those services? Will they use Internet access or will you have to provide a more dedicated connectivity solution?
* Identify the data needed by the solution you're deploying. What data is shared with other applications? Where will the data reside?
* What are the security requirements of your application?
* What are the high availability requirements?
* Do you have to provide connectivity to your on-premises data center? If so, how will you implement it?
* Do you have to implement connectivity to other (customer) sites? If so, how will you implement it?
